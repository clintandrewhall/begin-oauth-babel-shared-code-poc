## What is this?

This is a PoC for sharing common code without having to use `hydrate`. It allows for shared code between routes, (and I think even with tree-shaking?). It's just how my brain organizes code like this, so I thought I'd give it a try.

I added Typescript, Prettier, and a few other things while I was at it. Feedback welcome!

This is based on @brianleroux's OAuth article and example: https://github.com/begin-examples/learn-node-oauth

## Some Issues and Caveats

- If a route imports a common file that has an external dependency, the `package.json` within that route needs to include it. I haven't figured out a way to make this smarter, (yet).
- I usually roll with Webpack, but decided to give Rollup a try. I have to formally declare modules as `externals` to avoid errors. ‚òπÔ∏è
  - `@architect/functions` uses the `static` keyword as a variable name and can't be parsed by `babel` or `commonjs`, so I added it to `externals`.
  - When I do that, I have to remove the `commonjs` rollup plugin because it doesn't support dynamic requires. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  - Anyone awesome with rollup who can help me out?
